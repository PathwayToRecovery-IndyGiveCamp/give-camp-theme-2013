# ByVernacchia Theme
This is a Wordpress theme that I created for my blog. If you want to see it in action, you can go to [blog.byvernacchia.com](http://blog.byvernacchia.com).

## What this theme uses?
This theme uses the following scripts/frameworks:
* Wordpress (well I guess that's a given seeing as it's a Wordpress theme)
* jQuery
* Twitter Bootstrap (CSS Grid and JS)

## Options this theme has
* Customizable navigation
* Widgetized Sidebar
* Most Current jQuery utilizing Wordpress loading (1.8.2)
* All JS loaded via Wordpress and not just inserted into footer

I guess that is all for right now. I haven't totally finished it, but will be making changes as I have more time to do so.
