# ByVernacchia Wordpress Theme
This is a Wordpress theme that I created for my blog. If you want to see it in action, you can go to [blog.byvernacchia.com](http://blog.byvernacchia.com).

## What this theme uses?
This theme uses the following scripts/frameworks:
* Wordpress (well I guess that's a given seeing as it's a Wordpress theme)
* Twitter Bootstrap v2.2.1 (Responsive CSS Grid and JS)
  * Responsive grid customized for this theme. Change to tablet view is a little bigger than original
* jQuery

## Options this theme has:
1. Customizable navigation
2. Customizable background
3. Customizable Header (Logo)
4. Widgetized Sidebar
5. Featured Image support
6. Most Current jQuery utilizing Wordpress loading (1.8.2)
7. All JS loaded via Wordpress and not just inserted into footer

I guess that is all for right now. I haven't totally finished it, but will be making changes as I have more time to do so.
